A CAD template will provided for each of your halls
MODULE 2: MAP UPLOAD

We will create a CAD template for each of your halls for the client portal map processing 
After copying the corners, text and symbols from your CAD into the template we have created, you can begin processing the map

33:
First, log into the User Portal
Module 2: map upload
The User Portal provides a quick and simple way to convert your existing CAD files into instructions for Lionel

Go to https://portal.augustrobotics.com
Log in using the username and password that August Robotics provided you
Change your password after the first login by clicking the button with your initials on the top-right

Module 2: map upload
From here, you can either:
Upload a map, or
Create a new venue / hall. This only needs to be done once per hall

New page March 2024

37:
[Optional] If the hall is not in the system, you need to add a new venue / hall…
MODULE 2: MAP UPLOAD
If you are a floor marking contractor that works across different venues, you may need to add a “New venue” before adding a new hall
If you are a venue, simply select “Existing venue”, select your venue and then add a new hall

Remember: This step is only relevant if the hall is not yet in the system
New page March 2024



38:
Start off by specifying the name of the show 
Module 2: map upload
Select the show the map is for. If the show is not in the system, input the show details
Select the venue 
Select the hall 
New page



39:
Upload your map
Module 2: map upload
Upload your map as a DXF file. DXF 2007 is recommended.
Enter the version number.
If this is the first version of the map for that show, enter “01”
If you later upload an updated file, enter “02” and so on
The portal will not accept two maps with the same version number
Select a paint colour you plan to use to mark the show
Click “Parse Map”
New page
You have the option to provide your planned marking date 
Providing this date allows us to allocate support resources effectively


40:
Confirm the target layout is named ‘Model’ 
Module 2: map upload

Target Layout is always “Model”
First, we need to confirm which layout (drawing/ view) you want to work on
The default name for this Target Layout is ‘Model’
In most CAD plans, the default name is ‘Model’, but some files may use a different name. Please confirm your active layout is called ‘Model’ before proceeding
If it is not already named ‘Model’, simply right-click on the tab and rename it to ‘Model’. You should already be familiar with how to rename layouts in your CAD software

See this example from a typical CAD

41:

Identify the layers related to Devices
Module 2: map upload
In order to convert a CAD file into instructions for the robots, we need to parse the map i.e. allow Lionel to identify the different layers
The first set of layers provide the default positions for all your devices in the hall
The CAD template provided by August Robotics will already have these layers included for you
In the screenshot, we have shown the default layers from CAD template
These layers contain the locations of all the equipment in the hall, so that the Lionel robots and Guiding Stations can locate each other
While specifying these layers is optional, it is highly recommended
New page

42:
Next, identify the layers related to the marks
Module 2: map upload
If you want extra marks in the for long booth edges, tick this box
New page
If a mark is too close to an obstacle, an ‘Extension Mark’ is generated. The distance from the obstacle can be changed
IMPORTANT: These layers must contain all the information that needs to be marked. If it is not here, it will not be marked
Identify what needs to be marked…
… you also have the option to generate additional marks depending on the job needs
Where a mark is made on a tunnel cover, an extra mark can be made next to the tunnel (in case the tunnel cover is moved)
If an airwall crosses through a booth, an additional mark on either side of the airwall can be added

43:
Identify the layers related to obstacles and hall features
Module 2: map upload
The obstacle layer will contain all the permanent obstacles in the hall (e.g. walls and pillars)
The information layer can contain any other details that may be useful to orient yourself in the hall (e.g. electrical tunnels)
New page
The last set of layers provide information on the physical features of the hall
The CAD template provided by August Robotics will already have default layers included for you
In the screenshot, we have shown the default layers from CAD template

44:
Parse the map
Module 2: map upload
After the map has been parsed
Click the “View”       or “Edit”        icons to review

If you need to add or revise anything, you can
      Edit the map you just parsed (usually used for small changes), or
      Upload a new DXF file (usually used if booth layouts have changed), or
      Re-parse the current DXF file (usually used if you made a mistake in selecting layers)
Press F5 to refresh the page
Once the map has finished parsing, the number of marks to be painted will be displayed

What does Lionel do when it is running the job?
Module 5: job supervision
The Lionel robot, even without the assistance of a Guiding Station, has a rough sense of its location. It will move towards the location of a mark and stop when it believes it is there
Then, Lionel will use a camera to find the Guiding Station. The Guiding Station uses a laser to determine Lionel’s precise position
If Lionel is slightly off of the correct position, Lionel will adjust itself
Lionel will then make the mark by spraying paint from its nozzle
Lionel will take the most efficient route to complete all the marks, guided by the Map Server
Move, Stop, Adjust, Mark




127:
Lionel has a range of sensors
Module 5: job supervision
Lionel has multiple, independent sensors, resulting in a highly reliable obstacle avoidance and safety system
Level 1: Lidar
Level 2: Sonar
Level 3: Depth Camera


300 degree Lidar (Light detection and ranging) coverage, with 8 metre range
7 sonar sensors across the front and side of Lionel

Module 5: job supervision
One Lionel system consists of one robot and one Guiding Station
You can add additional Guiding Stations
You can add additional robots
This is required for halls that are large and halls with lots of pillars or other obstructions
Lionel always needs to establish line of sight to a Guiding Station to confirm and adjust its position before placing each mark
This enables you increase the speed of marking and complete the job faster


135:
Add Equipment: Use this page to add extra Lionel robots and/or Guiding Stations to your job
Module 5: job supervision
Click to ‘Set Up’ extra robots or Guiding Stations

Module 5: job supervision
Lionel has a camera to record each mark made and utilises AI to check each mark meets the quality standards
If the AI suspects a mark is bad quality, it will report a flagged mark 
Using the View Mark feature, you can review the flagged marks 
If the mark looks good, you can click Correct
If a mark is not to your liking, you can click Unpaint. If you unpaint the mark, the mark will be recorded as unpainted and reflected as such in the job report
Reminder: You will need to clean the mark and run the job again to paint a new mark

158:
Issue 1: Mark quality is poor (1/4)
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Complete and fully formed
Clear and crisp lines
Good paint coverage
A good quality mark should be...
There are two types of issues
Mark quality is inconsistent
Mark quality is good at the start but poor later on

159:
Issue 1: Mark quality is poor (2/4)
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Mark quality is inconsistent
1a)
Potential Root Cause
Suggested Action
The spray nozzle is blocked
Press and hold the ‘Preload’ button for longer and see if the marks improve
Uninstall the nozzle and wash it clean. Attach the nozzle to the cleaning syringe and push water through the nozzle 
Use a 0.2 to 0.3mm metal needle to dredge the nozzle and rinse with water
Change to a new nozzle
There are bubbles or particles in the paint
Hold the ‘Preload’ button and check if there are bubbles in the pipe system. If so, open the paint tank and check the paint mixture
Stir the paint mixture. If there are bubbles, carefully stir to remove the bubbles


160:
Issue 1: Mark quality is poor (3/4)
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Mark quality is inconsistent (continued)
Potential Root Cause
Suggested Action
There are old paint clots in the pipe system
(If the user does not clean the paint system after each job, the residual paint will dry and block the pipeline)
Follow the instructions in the cleaning module to flush water through Lionel’s pipes 
If the above does not work, connect a cleaning syringe to the cleaning pipe. Short circuit Lionel’s pipe system by disconnecting the pipe from the orange pump and connecting it to the cleaning pipe (see pictures). The purpose is to prevent water travelling through the orange pump. If water travels through the pump, the pump will be damaged. Then, use the syringe to push water through the pipes
Things are not properly connected in the pipe system
Check that every connector in the pipe system (from the paint tank to the nozzle) are properly connected 


161:
Issue 1: Mark quality is poor (4/4)
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Mark quality is good at the start but poor later on
1b)
Potential Root Cause
Suggested Action
The nozzle does not have a wet foam cap
Ensure there is a new foam cap for Lionel’s nozzle before every job 
Ensure you have added water to the foam cap before every job


162:
Issue 2: Right location, wrong mark
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Potential Root Cause
The CAD file was not clean and the map was incorrectly parsed in the User Portal
Select the mark in the Map Server Interface and check whether the mark shape is correct
If the mark is incorrect, click “Disable” to delete the mark
You can use the Map Server Interface to add a new mark
Lionel marked in the right location but with the wrong shape (e.g. the user wanted a “L” corner but Lionel marked a “T”)
Suggested Action



163:
Issue 3: Lionel or Guiding Station unable to connect
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Potential Root Cause
The hardware is not connected properly
Even after connecting a Mesh Router to Lionel / Guiding Station, the Lionel / Station is still in a “not connected” state
Suggested Action
Ensure the Mesh Router’s internet cable and power cable are properly connected to the Lionel / Guiding Station
The Mesh Router you are using does not match the Map Server
(You cannot use Mesh Routers from different Map Server boxes at the same time)
Ensure the serial number on the Mesh Router is the same as the serial number on the Map Server box
The light on the Mesh Router is red, not green
Use a different Mesh Router from the Map Server box and try again
The Lionel / Guiding Station hardware has not been properly started
Ensure the battery on Lionel / Guiding Station is properly connected
Restart the Lionel / Guiding Station by pressing the red switch and wait two minutes for the equipment to boot up

164:
Issue 4: Guiding Station cannot locate the Reference Beacon
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
When trying to calibrate the Guiding Station, the Guiding Station fails locate the Reference Beacons
Potential Root Cause
The Guiding Station has not been placed in the correct Home Base
Suggested Action (before restarting calibration)
Ensure you have placed the Guiding Station in the Home Base suggested by August Robotics
If you have placed the Guiding Station in a different place, check that on the Map Server interface, you have indicated you are using a customised Home Base and have moved the Guiding Station icon
The Guiding Station has not been placed in the correct orientation
Ensure you have placed the Guiding Station in the correct orientation based on the sticker
The two Reference Beacons have not been placed on top of the Reference Points
Ensure the two Reference Beacons are directly on top of the Reference Points, and that the downward lasers are aligned and the levelling bubbles centred
One of or both Reference Beacons have not been turned on
Check that the blue and green LED lights on both Beacons are on. If not, swap in a beacon from the inventory

165:
Issue 5: Lionel cannot locate the Guiding Station
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
When trying to calibrate Lionel, Lionel fails to locate the Guiding Station
Potential Root Cause
Lionel has not been placed in the correct Home Base
Suggested Action (before restarting calibration)
Ensure you have placed Lionel in the Home Base suggested by August Robotics
If you have placed Lionel in a different place, check that on the Map Server interface, you have indicated you are using a customised Home Base and have moved the Lionel icon
Lionel has not been placed in the correct orientation
Ensure the physical Lionel robot in the hall is facing the same orientation as the Lionel icon on the Map Server Interface

166:
Issue 6: Lionel tries but fails to localise
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Lionel moves and continues to localise but does not paint the mark, and eventually skips it. This occurs for a few marks
Potential Root Cause
There is too much light in the environment
Suggested Action (before restarting calibration)
(In rare cases, strong light behind Lionel or the Guiding Station impairs the localisation process)
Reduce the light in the environment (e.g. close the doors / blinds, stand behind the equipment for a few minutes to block the strong light)
Lionel moves and continues to localise but does not paint the mark, and eventually skips it. This occurs for most of or all the marks
Potential Root Cause
NA
Suggested Action (before restarting calibration)
Restart both the Lionel robot and the Guiding Station by pressing the red switch
Check the Map Server interface for any errors and follow the instructions to resolve
The camera on Lionel or the Guiding Station is blocked (unlikely)
Remove the object blocking the camera

167:
The Map Server Interface will provide error codes for issues and suggested actions
Module 7: proactive care and troubleshooting
Here is a sample of the most common error codes
The Map Server will alert you of errors and provide suggested actions for each error. If you cannot solve the issue after following the instructions, please record the error code and contact August Robotics

Advanced Operations


171:
In this section, we introduce 2 Advanced Operations features for advanced users
Advanced operations
Tailor your operations to best suit your specific floor marking needs and workflows. You have the ability to adjust several key settings:

Path Algorithm: Choose between optimized path algorithm or Snake Path to determine how Lionel will navigate between marks
Mark Setting: Adjust a variety of mark settings allowing you to customize the mark-out, including mark size, line type, mark offset and more
Speed: Adjust Lionel's travel speed, which impacts the accuracy of marking placement - higher speeds reduce accuracy while lower speeds increase precision
Priority Area: Define the area you would like Lionel to mark first
Adjust the job settings 
The Priority Area feature allows you to designate specific marking locations as high importance. When setting up a job, draw priority areas and Lionel will then plan its path to first complete all markings within the priority areas before moving to other locations.
This provides control to ensure critical areas are always marked first while optimizing overall efficiency. Priority area selection gives precise workflow management tailored to your event needs.


172:
Change the settings according to your job needs
Advanced operations
Before running the job, go to the Settings page to:
Select whether you would like to use Lionel’s optimized path or the Snake Path which allows you to move in a horizontal and vertical path
Select the line type (single or double), mark size, text type and offset
Select the speed by adjusting the accuracy tolerance
The highest accuracy will be the slowest and vice versa


173:
Priority Area: Mark your highest priority area first
Advanced operations
To add a priority area, tap the "Priority Area" icon in the job settings menu
Press “add” icon and a rectangle will appear - drag it to place over the desired area on the floor plan
Use the multi select tool to draw the priority area on the map
Tap outside the rectangle to save the priority area location and size
You can add up to 3 separate priority areas per job
To edit a priority area, tap the edit icon then drag or resize as needed
To remove a priority area, tap the Delete icon
After you have defined the priority area, pause and then restart any active robots. The robots will then be assigned to the priority area
