There are breaks in the marks / air in the pipe / poor mark quality overall,"Check the pipe from the bottle to the robot to ensure it isn't pinched and is correctly connected with an audible click when attaching the bottle; inspect the rest of the paint pipes for pinches, bends, or leaks; and clean or replace the nozzle if it is partially blocked, while also checking if the O-ring at the bottle connection is damaged."
Lionel won't mark a certain area of a job map,"Ensure that none of the marks in that zone are 'disabled,' refresh the webpage to confirm the marks haven't already been painted, and check that a 'temporary obstacle' wasn't created around these marks."
The Lionel is in a constant error / initialization state,"Ensure that the emergency stop button is released, check the notification bell on the webpage for any reported errors, and if the issue persists, perform a power cycle on Lionel and contact an AR representative."
Lionel nozzle is blocked / the nozzle is blocking frequently / the nozzle is dripping paint,"Perform a short preload using the button on Lionel to determine if the nozzle is partially or fully blocked, dredge the nozzle with the provided cleaning needles, replace it with a new, clean nozzle if needed, and ensure there is enough water in the foam cup or replace the foam."
The marks are inaccurate relative to their intended position in the venue,"Ensure that the Reference Beacons have been placed in the correct locations, verify that the Guiding Station is properly set up with all four feet firmly touching the ground, and check that the booths were copied into the correct location in the processed CAD file."
The marks are inaccurate relative to one-another,"Ensure that the Guiding Station is properly set up, with all four feet firmly touching the ground."
Lionel does not respond during the calibration step,"Ensure that a homebase has been selected for calibrating Lionel and that it has a clear line of sight to the Guiding Stations; if not, add a new homebase. Check for any errors using the notification icon on the top right corner of the webpage and confirm that the emergency stop is not pressed."
Mark is incorrect width,"Navigate to the 'Settings' page on the homepage of the map server on the tablet, select the correct mark width, and click the save button."
Mark is incorrect length,"Navigate to the 'Settings' page on the homepage of the map server on the tablet, select the correct mark length, and click the save button."
Lionel looks like stuck by invisible obstacles,"Check for physical obstructions on the sonar and depth camera, power cycle the robot, and disable or unplug the sonars to see if there is any improvement."
Lionel is not moving in a straight line / Wheel is dragging,"Conduct a visual inspection to identify any obstructions or debris caught in the wheels, power cycle the robot, and review the webpage for any reported errors."
"Lionel is flagging many marks as ""bad marks"" / Mark quality is poor",Verify the quality of the marks by previewing the mark's image on the webpage to determine if the nozzle is blocked or if there is a false alarm.
Lionels camera beacon can't rotate to its desired location,"Press the emergency stop button, rotate the camera beacon to face the back of Lionel, then release the emergency stop button. If the device is in an error state, press the 'Reset' button on the webpage. Finally, recalibrate Lionel and restart the job."
Lionel does not power on after toggling the switch,"Ensure that the battery is correctly installed, charged, and connected to the robot. Set the switch to the 'off' position for 10 seconds, then attempt to power on again. If the issue persists, consider replacing the fuse located next to the power switch; spare fuses should be available in the Map Server Box."
Lionel does not stop marking when the nozzle is blocked,Stop Lionel by clicking the 'Pause' button on the webpage. Restart Lionel and ensure that 'Stop After 5 Bad Marks' feature is enabled.
Lionel does not have line of sight to a Guiding Station,"If Lionel does not have line of sight to a Guiding Station, determine whether the obstruction is temporary or permanent. For permanent obstacles, update the CAD file for the hall. For temporary obstacles, use the 'Add Obstacle' feature on the map server webpage to define the proximity area of the obstruction."
Lionel is in a constant error / initialization state,"Ensure that the emergency stop button is released, check the notification bell on the webpage for any reported alarms, and if the problem persists, power cycle Lionel and contact an AR representative."
The Guiding Station can't find the Reference Beacons,"Verify that the selected homebase for the Guiding Station is correct and accurately positioned relative to the Guiding Stationâ€™s actual location. Confirm that the Reference Beacons are correctly positioned according to the map displayed on the webpage. Rotate the reference beacon head to avoid internal cables obstructing the light and check for any reflections from the Reference Beacons to nearby pillars."
Device stays in error state after EStop Released,"Click the 'Reset' button on the map server's webpage from the tablet, and if the device remains in an error state, perform a hardware power cycle."
"The Guiding Station pose stays ""Unlocated"" after finding both Reference Beacons",Ensure that the Reference Beacons are placed in the correct positions by comparing their coordinates on the processed map with those on the CAD file. The discrepancy between them should be within 10mm.
The Guiding Station camera beacon can't rotate to its desired location,"First, press the emergency stop button, then rotate the camera beacon to ensure the cable is not tangled. Afterward, release the emergency stop button and click the 'Reset' button on the GUI if the device is in an error state."
